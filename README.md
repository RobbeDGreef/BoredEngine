# BoredEngine
The bored engine is a very simple and light 2D game engine. It is a personal
learning project and that is obviously where it got its name from. 
The engine does not house a lot of features right now and a lot of stuff will
change in the future.

You are welcome to help contribute to this project and help build this engine
grow.
